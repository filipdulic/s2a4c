//! # Router Module
//!
//! This module provides the [Router] struct for managing asynchronous
//! request-response communication using unique identifiers (UUIDs). It
//! leverages the [async_channel] crate for message passing and the [tokio]
//! crate for asynchronous operations.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The [Router] struct is designed to facilitate the routing of requests and
//! responses between different components of an application. It uses channels
//! to send and receive requests and responses, ensuring that the communication
//! is non-blocking and efficient. Each request is associated with a unique UUID
//! to match it with the corresponding response.
//!
//! Also provided is a default implementation for easy instantiation with
//! pre-configured channel capacities.

/// - `Response`: any type that implements [Send] + [Clone] + 'static
